# Example Project (2026)

!!! note "How to use this template"

    This template is for ROX-Diff research, student projects, integration work, and temporary tests/demos. Write it so that a new maintainer can understand and reproduce the project without relying on the original author.

    Everything here on this page is an example and template that can be copied, repurposed and used however needed. One thing to note is that many projects have similar setup sequences and configs, so it might be worth exploring other existing projects and copying their workflow if it's similar, in order to save time on documenting :)

## Short summary

**One-sentence summary:** TODO: Explain the project in one sentence.

**Longer summary:** TODO: Explain the motivation, what was built or tested, and how it relates to the ROX-Diff, Aalto, and/or TwinFlow.

## Project metadata

| Field | Value |

| Project type | TODO: Research / Student / Temporary test / Integration / Demo |
| Status | TODO: Planned / Active / Paused / Completed / Archived |
| Start date | TODO: YYYY-MM-DD |

## Quick start

Use this section for the fastest safe path from zero to a working demo or test run.

``` bash title="Minimal startup commands"
# TODO: Activate environment
# source /opt/ros/<ros-distro>/setup.bash
# source ~/ros2_ws/install/setup.bash

# TODO: Start required launch file
# ros2 launch <package> <launch_file>.py
```

Expected result:

``` text
TODO: Describe what the user should see when the system works.
Example: RViz opens, /scan publishes, robot appears in map, controller becomes active.
```

!!! warning "Before running on the real robot"

    Confirm that the test area is clear, emergency stop is reachable, safety scanners are active, and make sure you understand the project and what it's suppose to do!

## System overview

You can explain the project architecture here. Include the robot, external PCs, sensors, network, data flow, and software nodes.

## Setup from a clean workstation

Write these steps as if the reader has a fresh computer and no project memory.

### 1. Prerequisites

- TODO: Operating system
- TODO: ROS 2 version
- TODO: Access rights
- TODO: Network requirements
- TODO: Physical lab access or simulation alternative

### 2. Clone repositories

``` bash title="Clone project repositories"
mkdir -p ~/rox_projects
cd ~/rox_projects

# TODO: Replace with real repository URLs
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
git checkout <branch-or-commit>
```

### 3. Install dependencies

=== "ROS 2 packages"

    ``` bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws
    rosdep update
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    colcon build --symlink-install
    source install/setup.bash
    ```

=== "Python environment"

    ``` bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

=== "Docker"

    ``` bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```

### 4. Configure environment

``` bash title="Environment variables"
# TODO: Replace values with the project-specific configuration.
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=<domain-id>
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=<rmw-implementation>
export ROBOT_NAME=<robot-name>
```

### 5. Verify installation

``` bash title="Basic ROS 2 checks"
ros2 doctor
ros2 topic list
ros2 node list
```

Expected output:

``` text
TODO: Add the expected topics, nodes, or health checks.
```

## Data management

| Data type | Save location | Format | Retention / archive note |
|---|---|---|---|
| rosbag logs | TODO | `.db3`, `.mcap`, etc. | TODO |
| Video/images | TODO | `.mp4`, `.png`, `.jpg` | TODO |
| Maps | TODO | `.yaml`, `.pgm`, `.png` | TODO |
| Configuration snapshots | TODO | `.yaml`, `.toml`, `.json` | TODO |
| Analysis outputs | TODO | `.csv`, `.ipynb`, figures | TODO |

!!! info "Configuration snapshots"

    Save the exact parameter files, launch files, map files, and commit hashes used for important experiments. Results are hard to reproduce without them.

## Known issues and limitations

| Issue | Impact | Workaround | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| TODO | TODO | TODO | TODO |

## Troubleshooting

??? question "ROS 2 nodes are not visible"

    Check that all machines use the correct ROS 2 distribution, `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`, middleware configuration, and network connection.

??? question "Robot does not move"

    Check emergency stop, safety scanner state, controller state, battery level, joystick/manual mode, and whether the correct command topic is being published.

??? question "Localization is unstable"

    Check the map, initial pose, TF tree, laser scan topic, time synchronization, and whether the environment has changed.

## Results and current status

Summarize the current state honestly.
